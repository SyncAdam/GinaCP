The project that teaches me *graphics programming* and much more.<br>
Note: this project now compiles using cmake. Use the configure.sh on linux or just type
``` bash
 cmake -S ..
```
in a build folder created by you.
Many thanks to the creator of [learnopengl](https://www.learnopengl.com) for all of the great material and resources.

**After compilation put shader source files into the same directory as the executable!!!**

Current state:
 - Camera movement
 - Basic vertex shader
 - Basic fragment shader
 - Ambient and diffuse lighting
