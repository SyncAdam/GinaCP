The project that teaches me *graphics programming* and much more.<br>
Note: this project won't compile without manual inclusion of glm (GL mathematics library). Many thanks to the creator of [learnopengl](https://www.learnopengl.com) for all of the great material and resources.

Current state:
 - Camera movement
 - Basic vertex shader
 - Basic fragment shader
 - Ambient and diffuse lighting
